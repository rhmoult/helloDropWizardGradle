# Dropwizard 1.2.2 + Gradle 

Modern example of Dropwizard working with Gradle instead of Maven.

Inspired by quad/dropwizard-gradle

Because my team prefers Gradle to Maven

## USAGE

git clone https://github.com/rhmoult/helloDropWizardGradle.git
cd helloDropWizardGradle
gradle run

Finally, in your browser, go to http://localhost:8080/hello-world
